# **Automatic ReadMe Generator**

## Project Description
This is a simple script that automatically generates a high quality readme file for a GitHub repo. Running this script in the command line with node will prompt the user for questions regarding their project such as title, description, installation instructions, type of license, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, GitHub username, and email for contact purposes. Once this information has been collected, the script will automatically generate a README.md file with all the information filled out and formatted professionally. This will save time for software developers and make their GitHub repository look professional to future collaborators, employers, or curious minded developers.
